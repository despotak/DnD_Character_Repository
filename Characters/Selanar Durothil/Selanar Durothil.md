## Character Concept

Selanar is a Sun Elf Mage from Myth Drannor. During his childhood, when he started weaving his first dweomercræft, the traces of an ancient tattoo appeared on his right forearm. A tattoo last seen worn by Josidiah Starym, at least 7 centuries ago, symbolizing the rank of the Spell-Major of Cormanthyr. He was just a fresh recruit of the Akh'Faer when the city fell for the second time. With the revival of Mystra and the reconstruction of the Weave, Selanar started working on his life-long quest to revive the old elven magic teachings of Arselu’Tel’Quess. To accomplice that, he looks for the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar, a set of small scrolls that described fundamental magical theory (Nether Scrolls) and the Ary'Faern'Kerym, the ancient Elfblade that signifies the rank of the Spell-Major, which he considers his right to bear.

## Backstory

*"It was Ches 10 in the year of Lightning Storms (1374 DR) when Arandur Durothil defied the will of the Durothil matron, Selsharra Durothil, and followed Seiveril Miritar back to Faerûn. If the greatest house is not going to help retake the elven ancestral lands back, then who is going to do it? When finally the city of Song was retaken, Arandur became the head of the Durothil house, while Selsharra stayed back in Evermeet, withholding her place in the Queen's High Council."*

Born in the year of the Risen Elfkin (1375 DR), the second son of Arandur, Selanar had always had an easy life. While Taenis, his brother, was to succeed their father as the head of the house, Selanar had the freedom to follow his own path. Arandur had great dreams for his children, wanting them to help the Tel'Quessir recover their lost grandeur. Their bed stories were about Aryvandaar and old Cormanthyr while the dark stories of the Crown Wars and the Fall of Myth Drannor were the prime examples of how even the mighty can fall.

Born to the house of Durothil comes with some baggage though, no matter how free you want to be. That is the case with Selanar as well since when he started weaving his first dweomercræft, the traces of an ancient tattoo appeared on his right  forearm. Fine azure lines with yellow finework among them wraps the entire forearm, with a series of four interlocking circles lengthwise along this tattoo and concentric lozenges intersecting the centers of the four rank circles, all in silver. A tattoo last seen worn by Josidiah Starym, at least 7 centuries ago, symbolizing the rank of the Spell-Major of Cormanthyr.

The tragic passing of Iamorasse Aluviirsan, their mother, was never fully explained and was speculated by many that it was a political assassination from the house's enemies. Fearing for the lives of his greatest treasures, Arandur sent both his sons away from Myth Drannor. Under the watchful eye of Berrenion Faerondalan, they were sent to the "Glade of Elistraee", the fortified secret retreat of House Durothil. Having lost both their parents practically, the brothers had only each other and Berrenion to hold on. It was not until their father's passing, many years later, that the children, men now, returned to Myth Drannor to reclaim their rightful place.

Under the care of Berrenion, both grow to become great examples and paragons of the House Durothil and the Ar'tel'quessir of Myth Drannor. Berrenion also initiated them to the Corellite clergy as Faerna. When the children came to age, Taenis followed the road of the warrior, like their father, while Selanar chose the path of Arselu'Tel'Quess, like their mother. Soon after his brother joined the military school in Evermeet, Selanar left to study at Lady's College. There he studied history, geography, biology, and many other fields. But most importantly he studied Cosmology and the Arcane. As a talented wizard and someone with a cooperative spirit, he joined the Order of the Silver Twilight, a fraternity inside the College whose objective is the advancement of magical knowledge through both ongoing research and archaeological investigation of lost arcane disciplines.

That led Selanar to an archeological expedition in the ruins of Sharlarion, to the ancient elven kingdom of Aryvandaaran. After years of research, hampered by the occasional attacks from the dhaeraow who want the secrets of the old city, as well as the remaining terrors that live in the ruins, Selanar's [treatise on Aryvandaaran](./Aryvandaar.pdf) was ready. This publication was greeted with respect from the mentors of the Academy, who awarded the title "Seeker of Mysteries" to Selanar for this.

Soon after this expedition, Selanar reunited with his brother for the funeral of their father. Taenis, as Arandur's heir, took over the reins of House Durothil and Selanar helped him to establish his station. The house's enemies became visible to the brothers and a great deal of time and effort was spent to fortify the house from future intrigues against them.

In the Year of the Rune Lords Triumphant (1487 DR) he, along with his brother, was among the knights that were tasked with protecting the Coronal, during that attack of the mercenary forces of the Netherese. At the end of the 3rd day of the fight he stood along with Taenis, Ilsevele Miritar, Fflar Starbrow Melruth, Storm Silverhand, and 3 more knights as the last defenders of the Tel'Quess. And when they gotten surrounded by the countless sell-swords is when he saw her; Sapphire-blue hair swirled, dark eyes blazed, the lone petite elf slashed with a sword that was not there, a bloody edge of sharp force sweeping through the air and cleaving flesh, bone, armor and blade alike. Srinshee. In a blink her visage blurred, along with the deepening darkness as the floating city came down on all their heads. The next blink he was somewhere else. Somewhere green and forested and familiar, that lacked tall spires and human butchers-for-coin beyond number and fallen Tel’Quess everywhere. He blinked again, to make sure. Semberholme, that’s where he was. There were elves everywhere around him, in bloody armor, swords in their hands, weeping and embracing. His people, the last Myth Drannans who’d fought beside Ilsevele, she who was now coronal of nowhere.

Three winters passed since then. With the revival of Mystra and the reconstruction of the Weave, Selanar started working on his quest to revive the old elven magic teachings of Arselu’Tel’Quess. He caught wind that Volothamp Geddarm was in Baldur's Gate, so he decided to pay him a visit. He made his way to Iriaebor to buy passage on a ship to the Grey Harbor.

## Lore

### House Durothil

Durothil claims to be one of the founding houses of the ancient Gold elven dynasties, and its members never cease letting people know it. Known as a great house of warriors and wizards, Durothil has many of its fighters among Evermeet's army, and has more high magi than any other house. The house's crest portrays a gold dragon's head, and its colors are yellow and white.

The family's current patriarch is the ancient high mage Ilianaro Durothil, who fought at the siege of Myth Drannor and carries the house's greatest weapon, the axe *Redethemar*, which is said to be bound with the spirit of an ancient elven goddess.

Durothil's estate in Leuthilspar, Evermeet is a vast wooden structure grown over centuries from a single grove of trees. The manse is said to have numerous secret passages and hidden rooms, and holds much treasure and ancient magic.

#### Notable members

- Prince Durothil, the heir to the throne of Tintageer and first Durothil who came to Faerûn
- Rolim Durothil, first patriarch of House Durothil on the island Evermeet.
- Ilianaro Durothil, patriarch of House Durothil as of 1368 DR and wielder of Redethemar.
- Selsharra Durothil, matron of House Durothil as of 1374 DR and a member of the Council of Evermeet.
- Aeramma Durothil, a sorcerer and member of the Circle of Reilloch Domayr, killed in 1374 DR.
- Soliania Durothil, a priestess who runs the Temple of Sehanine in Leuthilspar in 1368 DR.

### Cormanthyr

Cormanthyr is one of many Tel'Quessir (elven and eladrin) empires that have graced Faerûn. For much of recent history it has been in ruin, though recently it has risen again under a new Coronal. Its capital, Cormanthor, was the first of any city to have a mythal created by wizardry, whereas previously, all mythals were created by elven High Magic. After the mythal was raised the capital was referred to as Myth Drannor.

#### History

The history of the elven realm of Cormanthyr spans more than five millenia and dates back to the ancient forest of Arcorar where fledgling elven realms born from the Crown Wars existed.

##### Pre-History and Early History

Cormanthyr was formed from four existing elven realms settled in the forest of Arcorar, which would later become Cormanthor. The existing realms were Elven Court, Semberholme, Uvaeren, and Jhyrennstar. Problems began arising for the realms, including a meteor that destroyed Uvaeren and a drow incursion into Elven Court, and the Coronal Oacenth of Jhyrennstar, as a prophet of Labelas Enoreth, requested the creation of the Elfblades to determine a ruler who would unite the tribes to fight their foes together. Kahvoerm Irithyl was the first to draw the Rulers' Blade, and became to first Coronal of Cormanthyr in -4000 DR.

The early millennia of Cormanthyr were relatively uneventful. The title of Coronal was passed on through five more elves by -223 DR, when Eltargrim Irithyl took the throne. During this time, most of their conflicts came with the drow, who built the Twisted Tower and effected raids upon the elves and surrounding lands. Also during this time, the humans and dwarves began to settle on the fringes of Cormanthor, which made the elves nervous but led to Eltargrim's most renowned changes.

##### The Age of Alliance and the Decline

Following his interpretation of Coronal Oacenth's wishes, Eltargrim decided to embrace the approach of other races rather than be in conflict with them. In 220 DR, he opened the forests to any non-elf wizards and druids as well as non-human settlers. By 261 DR, he extended the Opening to the city of Myth Drannor despite rebellion and attacks on his life, and the city flourished for four hundred years.

However, in 661 DR, four centuries after the Opening, Eltargrim died, leaving a lone heir, Aravae Irithyl, who was unready to take the throne. Three years later, she was murdered, and left no heir. In 666 DR, the powerful wizard Srinshee enacted the Claiming Ceremony that was needed to identify a new ruler of Cormanthyr, by drawing the famed Rulers' Blade. Over many days, elves died in attempts to draw the sword to no avail, and in the end, the Srinshee herself was resigned to draw it. While successful, she did not take on the role of Coronal, and instead departed for Arvandor to leave the elves to mull over their sins. For the next fifty years, Cormanthyr fell under the rule of the Council of Twelve, and experienced great decline.

##### The Fall of Myth Drannor and the Retreat

In 711 DR, the Army of Darkness, led by the Trio Nefarious (recently released from their prison above Myth Drannor) attacked Cormanthyr in what became known as the Weeping War. The elves fought bravely and slew all three of the nycaloths who led the army, but ultimately Myth Drannor fell under fiendish control in 714 DR, and the realm fell into shambles.

For centuries to follow, the elves tried to contain the fiendish evil in Myth Drannor, having moved their power base to Elven Court. The realm became scattered and divided, and ultimately in 1344 DR the elves began the Retreat, when more than 90% of their population abandoned Cormanthor's woods for other settlements in the west. The dream that was Cormanthyr was over.

##### Modern Conflicts and the Revival

The woods of Cormanthor became infested with drow after the retreat, who moved into the abandoned habitats of their kin. These drow attempted to seize the mythals and use the power for their own purposes. However, their plans never came to fruition as Myth Drannor was invaded by Sarya Dlardrageth and her Daemonfey, who attempted to take control of the region in 1374 DR. In a complicated conflict involving the Zhentarim, Sembia and Hillsfar, the Dales, as well as an Elven Crusade from Evermeet and their allies in Evereska, the Cormanthor War was fought in the woods and surrounding Dales. Eventually, House Dlardrageth fell to the Crusade, which became the Army of Myth Drannor led by Ilsevele Miritar. The Army of Myth Drannor eventually defeated the Zhentarim and seized control of Cormanthyr for the first time in seven centuries. In 1377 DR, the Srinshee returned and granted the Rulers' Blade to Ilsevele, who drew it successfully and became the first Coronal of the Present Age.

In 1487 DR, after years of war against Netheril, Thultanthar fell upon Myth Drannor, destroying both cities and thereby the second Cormanthyr. Ilsevele and her surviving subjects fled to Semberholme.

### Quess'Ar'Teranthvar

Quess'Ar'Teranthvar, also known as the Golden Grove of Hidden Knowledge, are five sets of 10 Nether Scrolls each, changed into the form of a tree.

The empire of Netheril had acquired a set of the Nether Scrolls, explaining their rapid rise and their mastery of magic. The elves arranged for the scrolls theft from the Netherese, and secreted them away in Windsong Tower, in the city of Myth Drannor.

The elves learned that the scrolls had to be read in order, and also that every race that read them learned different information. For example, one of the main thieves of the scrolls was Rilmohx Sha'Quessir, a gnome elf-friend who learned a vast knowledge of illusion magic by glancing only briefly through the scrolls. The elves also learned that altering the scroll's form into something different allowed for hidden meanings to be revealed.

A High Mage named Tyvollus Aluviirsan therefore transformed the metal scrolls into a thin golden beech tree, with golden metal leaves, and with its trunk in the face of a treant. In the tree's foliage are a small silver bird and a snake with golden, silver, and electrum scales. The bird and snake are said to represent Corellon and Mystra, both deities of magic.

The Nether Scrolls, in this form, allows for six different ways of learning its secrets:

By analyzing the shape and structure of the roots, which spells out words in the ancient elven language, one learns of the basics of magical knowledge. This is the first set, the Arcaenus Fundare.
By reading the patterns and shapes of the leaves which form letters and words, one learns how to create magical items of all types. This is the second set, the Magicus Creare.
By listening to the animals in the tree, one learns of living self-sustaining magical fields, as well as of wild magic and dead magic. This is the third set, the Major Creare.
By listening to the rustling of the leaves, one learns of the multitude of planes, their interactions with each other, and how magic functions on each plane. This is the fourth set, the Planus Mechanicus.
The fifth set, the Ars Factum, was revealed only when the entire grove contorted its bark and branches into symbols along with the melodies of the leaves and animals singing in concert. This explained the creation and understanding of artifacts and the creation of new magical life-forms.
Finally, a sixth source of magical knowledge can be gleamed only once you consider all 50 scrolls as a whole. It taught the elves the upper levels of Weave spellcasting (10th and 11th level spells) as well as Elven High Magic rituals. This can only be learned by the snake and bird merging together into the form of a small golden dragon.
Tyvollus Aluviirsan remained with the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar, needing to use all of his concentration to force the tree to retain its shape (if he were separated from it the tree would have collapsed into molten metal. After 20 years or less, the metal would have once again reformed itself into the metal scrolls that the Netherese were familiar with).

In 1375 DR, agents of Hadrhune ripped the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar out of Windsong Tower, unbeknownst to the warriors of the Cormanthor War, and spirited it away to the Anauroch desert. Darcassan the Farseer managed to get word of the theft to the Liberators of Shadowdale but couldn't help them find its location other than to suggest that they seach for the Crypt of Augathra the Mad. They found it and the Lost Sage, who granted them a vision of a way to destroy the tree before the Shadovar could use it for their own ends. The adventurers managed to succeed in their task, dissolving the Quess'Ar'Teranthvar and scattering the component Nether Scrolls to the winds.

### Akh'Faer

The Akh'Faer (elven for Army of the Art) was the arcane branch of the Akh'Velahr military in the elven empire of Cormanthyr that existed up until the fall of Myth Drannor at the close of the Weeping War. Headquartered in the Art Tower of Castle Cormanthor, they numbered over four hundred akf'faern (members) during the empire's peak (circa 650 DR).

The Akh'Faer was mixed between the gold elves and the moon elves. They were comprised of roughly three hundred primary troops (4th- 8th level wizards), one hundred junior officers (9th to 12th level wizards) and fifty senior officers (13th level or higher wizards) below the leadership. The leader of the Akh'Faer is called the Spell-Major, and is chosen by ritual of blade-rite, having been able to successfully draw the Artblade. A Spell-Major also names his four second in command, the Spell-Captains.

The Akh'Faer, like the Akh'Velahr, use tattoos to signify rank. All of the akh'faern wear black lightning sigils on the backs of their hands. As they become officers, they gain a large tattoo made up of azure lines and as they progress, up to four interlocking circles are added. Once a senior officer, yellow is added to the azure to make it green, and further up they gain concentric lozenges in black, intersecting with the circles. Finally, a Spell-Major has all of his designs turned silver on green using the power of the Artblade or the painstaking skill of a tattoo artist.

### Ary'Faern'Kerym

The Artblade (also known as the Noble Sorcerer's Sword, or Ary'Faern'Kerym in Elven), is one of three Elfblades created in ancient Cormanthyr to help the elves establish a ruling family. This particular blade is used to name the Spell-Major, the Defender by Art, as he is called. The wielder of the Artblade is responsible for the upkeep of magical defenses of the realm, and command of the Akh'Faer, the arcane arm of the military.

The Artblade was created by Elven High Magic alongside its mates, the Warblade and the Rulers' Blade in -4000 DR, at the behest of the ill Coronal of Jhyrennstar, Oacenth, who desired the magical swords to determine the rulers of the united tribes and new nation of Cormanthyr.

For over four millennia, the sword served the elves well. However, in 450 DR, the Spell-Major Zaos Durothil lost the blade while battling the Red dragon Edallisufanxar. For a time, the sword was replaced by Faervian, a Baneblade, created by the human wizard Demron.

In 500 DR, the elven noble and bladesinger Josidiah Starym embarked on a famous quest to retrieve the Warblade from the Twisted Tower with a band of his adventuring friends but when he returned in 674 DR he had found the Artblade instead. Josidiah bore the Artblade until his demise in 714 DR during the Weeping War and the fall of Myth Drannor, when the blade was consumed in a great magical attack by the Starym noble.

The blade appears as if made of darkness, and its shape is a tangible black void, outlined in a crimson streak which is the source of the blade's light. It crackles like lightning when drawn, and creates a sharp buzzing sound when swung, like that of an angry bee. Oddly, when the blade strikes a foe, there is no sound from the hit, despite the strength behind it. An elven rune near the pommel signifies a thing of magic.

The Artblade like all of the elfblades has a bladerite, a test of character given by the blade itself. Passing the bladerite established a magical bond with the sword where the sword recognizes it's prospect as it's rightful wielder. Failing the Artblade would sever the prospect's connection to the Weave leaving them barren of magic for up to two decades. The blade favored arcane casters that had a selfless love for the Art and the people of Cormanthyr.

The bearer could sense magic and negate other's. In battle the blade could be used as a weapon while still allowing the wielder to cast. The blade channeled the bearer's magic acting as their material focus and used the wielder's swing and its own buzzing to complete the casting. 

Through the bond with the blade the wielder could call the blade to themselves from any location. This made the blade nearly impossible to be lost or stolen. This bond was only broken upon the death of the wielder.
