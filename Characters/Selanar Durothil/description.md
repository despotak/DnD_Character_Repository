# Intro

Hello, name is Chris and I have a character in the planning phase for a couple of years now. I might be getting a chance to play with him soon, so he needs someone to put my words into lines and colors for him.  
The basic gist of it is a noble elf that is trying to master the ancient ritualistic magic of the Elves (High elven magic for those that now a few things about the Forgotten Realms setting). His dream (my desire) is for him to find the lost, ancient elfblade, the symbol of the spell-major of his realm (the sword I describe below).

# Character Details

|||
|:-|:-|
|Gender:|Male|
|Age/appeared age:|~450 years old / 30ies-40ies in human years|
|Skin:|Bronze|
|Hair:|Long wavy golden blonde|
|Eyes:|Metalic silver|
|Distinguishing Marks:| ***Tattoo on his right hand/forearm:*** silver lightning sigil on hand-back, an elaborate and large tattoo of fine azure lines with yellow finework among them wraps an entire forearm; (while in all individual azure and yellow lines, only under close inspection can one actually see that the tattoo is not a solid green color from wrist to elbow). A series of up to four interlocking circles can be added lengthwise along this tattoo. Concentric lozenges either intersecting the centers of the four rank circles or surrounding all the circles on the outside, all in silver. (By no means I expect this to be clearly visible in detail. Just added the full description, since I have it, as a reference)|
|Significant item 1:|***Ary'Faern'Kerym:*** This sword appears as a long sword forged from solid darkness, the void of nonreflective blackness feeling as solid as stone yet slick as oil. Along the razor-sharp, bevelled edge of the blade glows a crimson beam of energy that encloses the darkness, the source of the elfblade's magical light. In contrast to the dark blade is a brightly glowing, crimson elven rune embossed near the pommel that is often used to signify a thing of magic. (single-edged lightly curved sabre blade, basket hilt. Think of Jacksons/Weta workshop elven swords instead of a historical medieval longsword.)|
|Significant item 2:|***Selu'Kiira:*** A platinum diadem with a blistering red tourmaline as the centerpiece.|
|Body Type:| 5'7'' (~1.70 m) tall. Fit, but not muscular. The body of a dancer, not a fighter|
|Color Scheme:|**Primary:** white, gold, silver, azure. **Secondary:** red, Tyrian purple, iridescent. **Materials:**  gold, platinum, silk, velvet|
|Gear:|He wears expensive/posh/high class clothes, but for love of Corellon, not a mage's robe. A shirt, trousers, overcoat, boots will do fine. Nothing of those is armored. He is noble going to a dance, even if the venue is on the battlefield. You can go wild, but **no robes** and **no staff** :P|
|Animal Companion:|He does have a faerie dragon as a familiar, but it is not required to draw that|
|Action/Pose:|Whatever you fancy|

# Character Persona

|Alignment:|Neutral Good|
|Personality Traits:|There’s nothing I like more than a good mystery. I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions. Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk; we all have the same blood. I’m confident in my own abilities and do what I can to instill confidence in others.|
|Ideals and Goals:|Nothing should fetter the infinite possibility inherent in all existence. What is beautiful points us beyond itself toward what is true. |
|Bonds and Flaws:|I hold no greater cause than my service to my people. I am easily distracted by the promise of information. I have an insatiable desire for carnal pleasures.|
|Motto:|*"Blood, lust, and pixie dust"*|

### Backstory

*It was Ches 10 in the year of the Lightning Storms when Arandur Durothil defied the will of the Durothil matron, Selsharra Durothil, and followed Seiveril Miritar back to Faerûn. If the greatest house is not going to help retake the elven ancestral lands back, then who is going to do it? When finally the city was retaken, Arandur became the head of the Durothil house, while Selsharra stayed back in Evermeet, withholding her place in the Queen’s High Council.*

Born in the year of the Risen Elfkin (1375 DR), the second son of Arandur, Selanar had always had an easy life. While Taenis, his brother, was to succeed their father as the head of the house, Selanar had the freedom to follow his own path. Arandur had great dreams for his children, wanting them to help the Tel’Quessir recover their lost grandeur. Their bed stories were about Aryvandaar and old Cormanthyr while the dark stories of the Crown Wars and the Fall of Myth Drannor were the prime example of how even the mighty can fall.

The tragic passing of Iamorasse Aluviirsan, their mother, was never fully explained and was speculated by many that it was a political assassination from the house’s enemies. Fearing for the lives of his greatest treasures, Arandur sent both his sons away from Myth Drannor. Under the watchful eye of Berrenion Faerondalan, they were sent to the “Glade of Elistraee”, the fortified secret retreat of House Durothil. Having lost both their parents practically, the brothers had only each other and Berrenion to hold on. It was not until their father’s passing, many years later, that the children, men now, returned to Myth Drannor to reclaim their rightful place.

Under the care of Berrenion, both grow to become great examples and paragons of the House Durothil and the Ar’tel’quessir of Myth Drannor. Berrenion also initiated them to the Corellite clergy as Faerna. When the children came to age, Taenis followed the road of the warrior, like their father, while Selanar chose the path of Arselu’Tel’Quess, like their mother. Soon after his brother joined the military school in Evermeet, Selanar left to study at Lady’s College. There he studied history, geography, biology, and many other fields. But most importantly he studied Cosmology and the Arcane. As a talented wizard and someone with a cooperative spirit, he joined the Order of the Silver Twilight, a fraternity inside the College whose objective is the advancement of magical knowledge through both ongoing research and archaeological investigation of lost arcane disciplines.

Soon after that, Selanar reunited with his brother for the funeral of their father. Taenis, as Arandur’s heir, took over the reins of House Durothil and Selanar helped him to establish his station. The house’s enemies became visible to the brothers and a great deal of time and effort was spent to fortify the house from future intrigues against them.

With the revival of Mystra and the reconstruction of the Weave, Selanar started working on his quest to revive the old elven magic teachings of Arselu’Tel’Quess.
