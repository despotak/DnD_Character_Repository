**Hit Points:** 1.000  (Damage Threshold 15)  
**Regeneration:** The hull regenerates 1 hp per hour

### Holofield
> *Holo-fields are programmable hologram fields utilized by the Eldar to defend themselves from enemy attacks. Rather than a typical force field which directly blocks an attack a holo-field distorts the user's image, preventing them from being hit in the first place. When stationary the field mimics the surrounding terrain so that the person or vehicle becomes invisible, but when they move the field causes their image to explode into a cloud of tiny, multi-coloured fragments, with the fragments dispersing more widely the faster they move and then collapsing back together as the subject stops, giving rise to the term jigsaw or domino field.*

**Effect:** Make the craft and the crew invisible to an outside observer, if the craft is not moving. If the craft is moving, the holofield causes attacks against the craft to have disadvantage.  

### Helm

### Eye of Harmony
> Extracting energy from a [charged rotating black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr%E2%80%93Newman_metric) ([Sphere of Annihilation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/sphere-of-annihilation) in D&D terminology) through a combination of [Hawking Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation) and the [Penrose process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process). In terms of SJ, it works like a [Pump Helm](https://spelljammer.fandom.com/wiki/Spelljammer_Helms#Pump_Helm) but with much greater efficiency.
