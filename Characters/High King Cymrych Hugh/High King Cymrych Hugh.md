**Enemies:**

* [Kazgaroth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Kazgaroth): also spelled Kazgoroth, is an aspect of Malar, who is a powerful, intelligent, evil beast opposed to the balance and the influence of the Earthmother on the Moonshae Isles. It would periodically ravage the land until it was defeated, only to return several years later.

- Later the same year Queen Allisynn succumbs to wounds suffered during the war against Kazgaroth. Cymrych Hugh commissions the construction of a palace to house his wife's body and fills it with vast treasures. Druids then send Caer Allisynn to a watery grave beneath the Strait of Alaron.
